# Digit-Recognition
Real-time Image Recognition using Computer Vision and Deep Neural Networks

•	Developed a 5-layer deep neural network using ReLu and Softmax activations for digit recognition in a real-time video stream

•	Optimized loss using mini-batch gradient descent and tuned epoch learning-rates to achieve 99.50% test accuracy
